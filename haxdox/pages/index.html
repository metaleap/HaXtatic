<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>These are the user docs on HaXtatic:</p>
<ul>
	<li>neither the first, nor the last .. neither the most powerful, nor the most minimalist .. simply just, wait for it ..</li>
	<li>yet another <b>static-site generator</b>! You heard that right.</li>
	<li>So step aside into obscurity, Macromedia Dreamweaver and Microsoft FrontPage! It's the mid-2010s at last and we're all command-line jocks now.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Hacked-together for hacking fine things together the (broadly imagined) "old-school way" &mdash; and probably really only possibly compelling (for users other than me, compared to other such tools) in case you wish to command some awfully-intricate-templating powers and know to code up at least simple pieces of <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> in a pinch: because I have written it from the ground up with easy-speedy, "done-and-done" future extensibility chiefly in mind.
</p>
<p>To be fair though: it <i>does</i> actually accomplish quite a lot without ever needing to touch its codebase &mdash; alas you'll have to run-from-source (or compile from scratch) no less.</p>
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Fetch from <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/HaXtatic">Github</a></li>
	<li>
		Run with <a href="https://www.haskell.org/downloads#stack">Haskell Stack</a> (with <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MissingH">MissingH</a> installed)
		<ul>
			<li>first via: <code>stack runghc ./main.hs</code> to see a note on how to <i>really</i> run this.</li>
			<li>(unless of course you prefer to another way of building-running Haskell programs)</li>
			<li>now run: <code>stack runghc ./main.hs <i>~/where/ever/</i>mydemosite.foo/</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Dig into the freshly generated and populated <code>mydemosite.foo</code> project-directory to grasp the bare essentials from the pre-created default single-page site in there.</li>
	<li>Dig into the project-directory (<code>haxdox</code> folder inside <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/HaXtatic/tree/master/docs">docs</a>) for this very Docs site to figure out most-of-the-rest.</li>
</ol>
