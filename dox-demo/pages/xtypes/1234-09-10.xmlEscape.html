	As a general principle, <b>none</b> of the built-in X-renderers <b>ever</b> HTML/XML-escape, <i>of their own accord</i>, their generated
	output derived from custom inputs: users are expected to specify such inputs already-escaped as the project's / file's output format demands.
</p>
<p>
	As such, some projects might for example require XML/HTML-escaping other {X|lt:index haXtag|} outputs dynamically/selectively
	after the fact: and this is where <b>{P|fileBaseName|}</b> offers a handy way out.
