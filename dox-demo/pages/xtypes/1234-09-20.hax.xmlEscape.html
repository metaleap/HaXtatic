	As a general principle, <b>none</b> of the built-in X-renderers <b>ever</b> HTML/XML-escape, <i>of their own accord</i>
	(unless expressly set up to do so on specific occasions), any of their generated outputs derived from project inputs:
	users are expected to specify such inputs already-escaped as the project's / file's output format demands.
</p>
<p>
	As such, some projects might for example require XML/HTML-escaping other {X|lt:index haXtag|} outputs
	dynamically/selectively after-the-fact; such is accomplished by embedding them inside a <b>hax.xmlEscape</b> X-tag.
