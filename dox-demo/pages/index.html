<p class="up">These are the user docs on {T|Hax|}: another <i>*ahem*</i> <b>static site generator</b>.</p>
{X|h: In 1 paragraph (okay, now 6) |}
<p><b>To summarize, in one handy package we get:</b> {X|lb:tmplsnip#snippets "controls"|} (aka. "components" aka. sub-templates aka. parametric-snippets aka. what-have-you-lets) &mdash; {X|lx:repeat iterating renderers|} &mdash; {X|lx:miniTag short|}-{X|lx:link hand|} {X|lx:image helper|} (haX)tags &mdash; {X|lx:links navigation|} {X|lx:pageAnchors helpers|} &mdash; {X|lt:p page context / page metadata haxTags|} &mdash; mix-and-match-and-combine-and-nest any haXtags &mdash; embed haXtags anywhere (source contents, {X|lb:tmplsnip templates|}/{X|lb:tmplsnip#snippets snippets(-aka.-controls)|}</a>, {X|lb:haxproj project/config file|}) &mdash; some almost-enough-for-a-coder's-minimalist-blog-or-three "section-of-related-pages" notion called {X|lb:bloks "Bloks"|} &mdash; globally shared (even-simpler-than-controls) {X|lt:t textual/markup snippets|} of course &mdash; custom {X|lt:p#Custom per-page variables|} &mdash; commonly desirable {X|lb:xmlfiles XML outputs|} (<i>sitemap.xml</i>, <i>*.atom</i>) &mdash; mod-time-differential rebuilds &mdash; per-page caching across runs &mdash; of course {X|lb:tmplsnip per-file-type templating|} &mdash; composable {X|lb:namedsetups "named setups"|} &mdash; {X|lb:haxproj extensive configurability|} &mdash; some notion of {X|lb:haxproj#pdecl "postings"/"simpleton data records"/"static tweets" micro-content definitions|} (with fully custom rendering) &mdash; easily defined, easily applied {X|lb:datetime#dtformats custom date-time formats|} ...</p>
<p><small>(That's without touching the code-base. There's a lean and insta-grok'able extensibility mechanism for adding custom output rendering logic in Haskell, too. Though {T|Hax|}'s combination of {X|lx:index built-in renderers|} combined with its {X|lt:index nestable haxTags|} and {X|lb:tmplsnip#snippets custom-parametric-markup-snippets|} (aka. "controls"/"components") does almost anything (incl. looping over various ranges) already except branching; that one hasn't been needed yet, basically.)</small></p>
<p><b>No "routes"</b> or some such notion. That's just.. <i>newfangled</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, <b>no "MarkDown" either</b>. If the occasional angle bracket or named entity baffles you, enjoy the sensation, or set up a separate .md-to-.html process for that, or (most likely) just go with the countless other site-gens.</p>
<p>To top it off, <b>no embedded-local-web-server either</b>. For a static site?! Get outa'town. (Emitting correct relative URLs that also work locally without a server is {X|lt:p#relpaths easy enough|} if you <i>must</i> have content pages inside sub-directories &mdash; and haXtags can be placed and processed inside CSS/JS files too.)</p>
<p>Git(Hub) integration? Docker play&amp;pluggery? Content-aware on-the-fly dependency tracking via embedded PhD-thesis with Van Schlauberg ad-hoc proofs and Nodejs hooks? Type-safe <i>everything</i>? <b>Uh-huh.</b> Ain't nobody got time for tomfoolery!</p>
{X|h: Quick start |}
<ol>
	<li>Fetch from <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic">Github</a></li>
	<li>
		Run with <a href="http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/">Stack</a> (a one-off 10-15 MB download)
		<ul>
			<li>first via: <code><span>haxtatic/src/</span>$ stack ./@HaxMain.hs</code> to see a quick notice on how to <i>really</i> run this <ul><li>(unlike all future runs, this very first run will take a while and possibly output countless semi-obscure progress notices, as a fresh {X|c:stack|} first fetches the appropriate Haskell compiler (several~100s MB) to run {T|Hax|} from source &mdash; a one-off expense)</li></ul></li>
			<li>now run: <code><span>haxtatic/src/</span>$ stack ./@HaxMain.hs <i>~/where/ever/</i>mydemosite.foo/</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Explore the {X|lb:projdir#Get%20started freshly generated and populated|} <code>mydemosite.foo</code> project-directory to grasp the bare essentials from the pre-created default single-page site in there.</li>
	<li>Dig through <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic/tree/master/dox-demo">the project-directory for this very Docs site</a> (or indeed skim over these here docs!) to figure out most-of-the-rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the program is appreciated and <i>in actual use</i> for real projects, then an executable binary for your OS/arch combo can also be compiled from the source via {X|c:stack|} quite trivially, if so inclined &mdash; that should give it a fair speed-up!
</p>
{X|h: In context |}
<p>
	<b>Hacked-together for hacking-together some fine sites</b> the (mostly imagined) "old-school way" &mdash; certainly a rather hacky way &mdash; and honestly among all the alternatives possibly <i>only</i> remotely, mildly "more compelling" in case you wish to (or have to) command some awfully-convoluted-templating powers and optionally &mdash;in a pinch, as a last resort&mdash; are content to code up at least simple short pieces of <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> (starting from <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic/blob/master/src/X/demoSimplest.hs">this</a> or <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic/blob/master/src/X/demoCfgArgs.hs">this</a>) &mdash; I wrote it from the ground up with easy-speedy, "done-and-done" future (rendering) extensibility chiefly in mind.
</p>
<h3>Not that you should have to for most needs, though!</h3>
<p>&mdash; except perhaps for the most exotic of uses (or "abusing" it for other neatly-hacky text-to-text / bulk transformations).. <b>this tool <i>does</i> actually accomplish quite a lot</b> without really needing to touch its codebase &mdash; just have to turn {X|lb:haxproj config-file|} warrior and in places wrestle minor amounts of trivial-yet-unforgiving {X|lb:syntax syntax|} &mdash; alas you'll have to run-from-source (or compile from scratch) no less.. for no good reason other than plain inertia on my part. (Redistributing precompiled executable binaries of my open-source work for various platforms hasn't made it onto my exhaustive list of <i>actual priorities</i>. Though emitting overly wordy verbiage in software documentation <i>has</i>, apparently, unwittingly. Confound it!)</p>
