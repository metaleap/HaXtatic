<p class="up">These are the user docs on HaXtatic:</p>
<ul class="up">
	<li>neither the first, nor the last .. neither the most powerful, nor the most minimalist .. simply just, wait for it ..</li>
	<li>another <b>static site generator</b> <i>*ahem*</i>. You heard that right!</li>
	<li>So step aside into obscurity, Macromedia Dreamweaver and Microsoft FrontPage.. it's the late-2010s at last and somehow we all turned into command-line jocks by now (not quite what the late '90s envisioned, but as ever history has the last laugh)</li>
</ul>
{X|h: HaXtatic in 1 paragraph: |}
<p><b>To summarize, in one handy package we get:</b> <a href="#">"controls"</a> (aka. "components" aka. sub-templates aka. parametric-snippets aka. what-have-you-lets) &mdash; <a href="#">iterating renderers</a> &mdash; <a href="#">short</a>-<a href="#">hand</a> (haX)tags &mdash; <a href="#">navigation helpers</a> &mdash; <a href="#">page-context / metadata haxTags</a> &mdash; mix-and-match-and-combine-and-nest any haXtags &mdash; embed haXtags anywhere (source contents, <a href="#">templates/snippets(-aka.-controls)</a>, <a href="#">project/config file</a>) &mdash; some almost-enough-for-a-coder's-minimalist-blog-or-three "section-of-related-pages" notion called <a href="#">"Bloks"</a> &mdash; globally shared (even-simpler-than-controls) <a href="#">textual/markup snippets</a> of course &mdash; commonly desirable <a href="#">XML outputs</a> (sitemap, atom) &mdash; mod-time-differential rebuilds &mdash; per-page caching across runs &mdash; of course <a href="#">per-file-type main-templates</a> &mdash; composable <a href="#">"named setups"</a> &mdash; <a href="#">extensive configurability</a> &mdash; some notion of <a href="#">"postings"/"data records" micro-content definitions</a> (with fully custom rendering) &mdash; easily defined, easily applied <a href="#">custom date-time formats</a> ...</p>
<p>(That's without touching the code-base. There's a lean and easily comprehended extensibility mechanism for writing custom output rendering logic in Haskell, too. Though HaXtatic's built-in renderers combined with custom parametric markup snippets &mdash;aka. "controls"/"components"&mdash; do almost anything except branching. Hasn't been needed yet, basically.)</p>
<p>No "routes" or some such notion. That's just.. <i>newfangled</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, <b>no "MarkDown" either</b>. If the occasional angle bracket or named entity baffles you, enjoy the sensation, or set up a separate .md-to-.html process for that, or (most likely) just go with the countless other site-gens.</p>
<p>To top it off, no embedded-local-web-server either. For a static site?! Get outa'town. (Emitting correct relative URLs that also work locally without a server is <a href="#">easy enough</a> if you <i>must</i> have content pages inside sub-directories &mdash; and haXtags can be placed and processed inside CSS/JS files too.)</p>
<p>Git(Hub) integration? Docker pluggery? Content-aware on-the-fly dependency tracking via embedded PhD-thesis with Van Schlauwitz ad-hoc proofs and Nodejs hooks? Type-safe <i>everything</i>? <b>Uh-huh.</b> Ain't nobody got time for tomfoolery!</p>
{X|h: Quick start |}
<ol>
	<li>Fetch from <a href="http://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic">Github</a></li>
	<li>
		Run with <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/">Stack</a> (a one-off 10-15 MB download)
		<ul>
			<li>first via: <code><span>haxtatic/src/</span>$ stack ./@HaxMain.hs</code> to see a quick notice on how to <i>really</i> run this <ul><li>(unlike all future runs, this very first run will take a while and possibly output countless semi-obscure progress notices, as a fresh {X|c:stack|} first fetches the appropriate Haskell compiler (several~100s MB) to run HaXtatic from source &mdash; a one-off expense)</li></ul></li>
			<li>now run: <code><span>haxtatic/src/</span>$ stack ./@HaxMain.hs <i>~/where/ever/</i>mydemosite.foo/</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Explore the freshly generated and populated <code>mydemosite.foo</code> project-directory to grasp the bare essentials from the pre-created default single-page site in there.</li>
	<li>Dig through <a href="https://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic/tree/master/dox-demo">the project-directory for this very Docs site</a> (or indeed skim over these here docs!) to figure out most-of-the-rest.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the program is appreciated and <i>in actual use</i> for real projects, then an executable binary for your OS/arch combo can also be compiled from the source via {X|c:stack|} quite trivially, if so inclined &mdash; that should give it a fair speed-up!
</p>
{X|h: How it came about |}
<p>
	<b>Hacked-together for hacking-together some fine sites</b> the (mostly imagined) "old-school way" &mdash; certainly a rather hacky way &mdash; and honestly among all the alternatives possibly <i>only</i> remotely, mildly "more compelling" in case you wish to (or have to) command some awfully-convoluted-templating powers and optionally &mdash;in a pinch, as a last resort&mdash; are content to code up at least simple short pieces of <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a> (starting from <a href="https://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic/blob/master/src/X/DemoSimplest.hs">this</a> or <a href="https://github.com/metaleap/haxtatic/blob/master/src/X/DemoCfgArgs.hs">this</a>) &mdash; I wrote it from the ground up with easy-speedy, "done-and-done" future (rendering) extensibility chiefly in mind.
</p>
<h3>Not that you should have to for most needs, though!</h3>
<p>&mdash; except perhaps for the most exotic of uses (or "abusing" it for other neatly-hacky text-to-text / bulk transformations).. <b>this tool <i>does</i> actually accomplish quite a lot</b> without really needing to touch its codebase &mdash; just have to turn <a href="#">config-file</a> warrior and in places wrestle minor amounts of trivial-yet-unforgiving <a href="#">syntax</a> &mdash; alas you'll have to run-from-source (or compile from scratch) no less.. for no good reason other than plain inertia on my part. (Redistributing precompiled executable binaries of my open-source work for various platforms hasn't made it onto my exhaustive list of <i>actual priorities</i>. Though emitting overly wordy verbiage in software documentation <i>has</i>, apparently, unwittingly. Confound it!)</p>
