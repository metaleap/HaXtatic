<p class="up">
	A near-empty {X|c: <i>default</i>.haxproj|} file was {X|lb:projdir#files created|} during project creation, as were a pre-authored {X|c: tmpl/<i>default</i>.haxtmpl.html|} file and a {X|c: <i>default</i>-build|} directory. Here's why they all share <b>default</b> in their names and how "setup names" can be leveraged for more finegrained project experiments / variations.
</p>
{X|h: Multiple *.haxproj|}
<p>
	{X|lb:projdir#run When <i>{T|Hax|}</i> is run, it is at a minimum always given a project directory path to work in|}, but following that one required command-line argument there may be <b>any number of <i>*.haxproj</i> file names</b> (not paths, and separated via white-space). Only when these <i>aren't</i> specified does {T|Hax|} actually assume a single <i>default.haxproj</i> is to be used.
</p>
<p>
	So all the specified {X|lb:haxproj *.haxproj|} files are loaded in sequence and combined-into-one in memory on the fly. This may result in later definitions overriding previous ones, which in turn can be really quite handy (once the need materializes).
</p>
<p>
	If any one of these named files doesn't exist, it is quietly ignored. If <i>none</i> of them exist, the above-mentioned fallback to <i>default.haxproj</i> applies. If <i>that</i> one doesn't exist, a minimalist pre-authored version is re-created to demonstrate just how seriously <i>{T|Hax|}</i> takes all this.
</p>
{X|h: Named setups|}
<p>The above logic then easily gives rise to the concept of "named setups", that is: multiple separate (differently named) sets of {P|triple:&lt;name&gt;|} co-residing in parallel within the project directory.</p>
<h3>Why:</h3>
<p>This may sound somewhat convoluted, but consider that <i>(despite this functionality emerging rather on a whim upon determining the real need for and utility of supporting multiple *.haxproj)</i> there could certainly well exist use-cases where developing/generating a number of "quite-similar-but-differing-in-various-minor-or-major-details" versions/variations of a project &mdash;from partially shared, partially differing contents, templates, snippets, settings&mdash; is upon reflection ultimately called for. Happens to the best of them!</p>
<p>Since most other variations can be finely controlled entirely via the <i>*.haxproj files</i>, the "named setup" concept only affects these 3 entities of {P|triple:&lt;name&gt;|}.</p>
<h3>So what exactly <i>does</i> "name" the current build setup then?</h3>
<p>The <i>very first</i> of all the specified <i>*.haxproj</i> file names supplied over the command-line, as <a href="#Multiple *.haxproj">per above</a> &mdash; but existing or not, loaded or not: the first one names this setup! All this shows how new projects end up with the standard set of {P|triple:default|} &mdash; the setup name falls back to <b>default</b> absent any explicitly specified other <i>*.haxproj</i> file names.</p>
